cows and bulls game written in c.

Please note that i do not own the game it self, just this C version that i coded myself .


#Explanation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows

" the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:

    Secret number: 4271
    Opponent's try: 1234
    Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game. As the first player has a logical advantage, the game can be balanced over multiple games by alternating the right to go first, or over a single game by granting the second player an equal number of guesses, possibly resulting in a tie. . . ."


in tis case there going to be just one player, since the program will be the one choosing and verifiying the answers for the player .
